# challenge-one
Simple Node developer challenge.

### Goal
Clone this repo and build a simple key/value store CLI using only the core Node API. Once you have finished the challenge zip and email your solution to the email provided.

### Store API

`$ store add mykey myvalue`

`$ store list`

`$ store get mykey`

`$ store remove mykey`

## Note
Main source code is found in index.js.
I've assumed that the CLI is only intended to add/read/delete key/pairs and not modify them.
Be sure to run the npm link command from the command line from the DanielLavigneTest directory before attempting the commands."
